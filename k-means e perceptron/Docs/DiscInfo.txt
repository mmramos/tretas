Disc Information

This disc contains information about and data from eleven wells in the National 
Petroleum Reserve in Alaska. The following data types are provided for each 
well: 
    o Core Images 
    o Depths to Selected Stratigraphic Horizons 
    o Geological and Drilling Reports 
    o Well Core Gamma Ray Data 
    o LAS-Format Well Log Data 
    o Permeability, Porosity, and Grain Density Data 

All files are ASCII text with the exception of the Core Image files, which are 
.GIF binary image file format.
