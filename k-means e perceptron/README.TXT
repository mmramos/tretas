INTRODUCTION
This CD-ROM makes available selected data sets from eleven wildcat 
wells drilled in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska (NPRA). 
It is designed strictly as a "data archive" with a simple HTML 
interface to aid in navigating the disc. 

The CD-ROM was written to the ISO 9660 standard and was produced 
to work in the greatest number of environments. The HTML was written 
as generically as possible in order to work with as many browsers 
and operating systems as possible. The Adobe Acrobat PDF files were 
kept below 4 megabytes (MB's) in order to avoid the problem some 
browsers have with PDF files greater than that size. Further, the 
smaller file sizes facilitate serving this disc over a network. 

The following data types are provided for each well: 
    o Photographs of Cores 
    o Depths to Selected Stratigraphic Horizons 
    o Geological and Drilling Reports 
    o LAS-Format Core-Gamma Ray Data 
    o LAS-Format Borehole-log Data 
    o Permeability, Porosity, and Grain Density Data 

All files are ASCII text with the exception of the Photographs of 
Cores, which are .GIF binary image file format, and the Drilling 
History and Geological Reports, which are Adobe Acrobat PDF files. 


VIEWING THE DATA
The data on this disc are viewable through a web browser by opening the 
HTML file "WorkShop.htm", located in the root, or top level, folder.  
WorkShop.htm is the "homepage" for accessing the other HTML files which 
display the data on this disc.  Other information, such as disc structure 
and content, data sources, disclaimer, acknowledgements, and author 
information is also accessible through WorkShop.htm.

Please see either DiscInfo.htm or DiscInfo.txt, accessible either 
through WorkShop.htm or directly in the Docs folder, for more 
information.
