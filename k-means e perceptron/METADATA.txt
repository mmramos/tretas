  Description:
    Abstract:
      Between 1978 and 1981, the U.S. Geological Survey drilled 27
      wells in the National Petroleum Reserve in Alaska.  This
      publication presents the following data from eleven of those
      27 wells: general information, well core images, depths to
      specific stratigraphic units, well core gamma ray logs
      in LAS format, well log information in LAS format, geological
      and drilling history reports in Adobe Acrobat PDF format, and
      permeability and porosity data.
    Purpose:
      These data were collected and distributed in support of the USGS
      NPRA Core Workshop held March 24th to 26th, 1999.
